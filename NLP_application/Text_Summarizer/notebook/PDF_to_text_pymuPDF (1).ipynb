      "food grain production. But, at the same time, a staggeringly higher percent of \n",
      "food grains is also being wasted at different stages of food supply chains. It is \n",
      "estimated that this wasted quantity of food grains is enough to feed our \n",
      "hungry population, including those who are starving and malnourished. It must \n",
      "be understood that food losses not only have an impact on food security for \n",
      "poor people, but also have a grater repercussion on economic development of \n",

      "Though the issue of food wastage is much more rooted in the actual \n",
      "handling, storage, transport of food grains and vegetables before they even \n",
      "reach the consumer’s plate, the matter of food waste and the amount of food \n",
      "thrown away at the consumption level, especially at the social gatherings can’t \n",
      "be ignored. India is often called the land of feasts, fasts and festivals. \n",
      "Celebrating social functions is a part of Indian tradition since ages. We \n",

      "births, deaths, where food is prepared on large scale on these occasions. \n",
      "With globalization and liberalization the economic prosperity of the nation has \n",
      "seen an upward trend which has pumped huge quantity of wealth into the \n",
      "country. Social events particularly weddings have turned into extravagant \n",
      "show of flaunting social status, wealth and prestige. Wedding celebrations \n",
      "seem too lavish, juxtaposed against the extreme poverty in India.  However, in \n",

      "food habits have also changed. The wealthy especially the new rich who have \n",

      "displays. As a result the problem of food wastage is growing. It is impossible \n",
      "for anyone to taste this wide array of dishes and hence large quantity of food \n",
      "is wasted which is either thrown into the municipal dustbins or at some \n",

      "Background \n",
      "India has made rapid progress in food production and achieved near \n",
      "self-sufficiency in the food grain production but it is also a fact that India is \n",
      "home to the largest number of hungry people in the world and about 214 \n",
      "million people of the country are chronically food insecure. It is estimated that \n",
      "46% of children below three years are underweight, 79% of children aged 6-\n",
      "35 months have anaemia, 23 per cent have a low birth weight and 68 out of \n",
      "1000 die before the age of one year, and 33% of women and 28% of men \n",
      "have a Body Mass Index (BMI) below normal just because they do not have \n",
      "enough food to eat. Unfortunately, the problem of hunger and food scarcity \n",
      "becomes serious because a staggeringly higher percent of food grains is \n",
      "being wasted at different stages of food supply chains. Various studies have \n",
      "shown that the issue of food wastage in India is much more rooted in the \n",
      "actual handling, storage, transport of food grains and vegetables before they \n",
      "even reach the consumer’s plate or find themselves in shopper’s baskets. \n",
      "However the matter of food waste and the amount of food thrown away at the \n",
      "consumption level, specially at the social gatherings also can not be ignored. \n",
      " \n",
      "India is often called the land of feasts, fasts and festivals. We \n",
      "passionately and frequently observe seasonal festivals, religious holidays and \n",
      "life transitions such as weddings, births, deaths etc. Among all the social \n",
      "gatherings, weddings are one of the most special occasions for us and we \n",
      "celebrate it with great enthusiasm. On this occasion, food is prepared on a \n",
      "large scale and relatives, fellow villagers/ neighbours and friends are invited \n",
      "for the feast. Though in the past, especially in rural areas, wedding celebration \n",
      "continued for several days but limited numbers of traditional food items were \n",
      "prepared for the same. Therefore, the quantum and the incident of food waste \n",
      "were negligible. If some food remained uneaten or unserved, it was either \n",
      "consumed by the members of the household themselves or distributed to the \n",
      "fellow villagers, extended families and relatives for consumption.  \n",

      "rural areas, the wedding celebrations to be getting extremely lavish, especially \n",
      "in contrast to the extreme poverty of rural Indian life. Now a days many \n",
      "weddings seem less influenced by norms in the village than by patterns in \n",
      "cities, and celebrations of poor families imitate the more extravagant patterns \n",
      "common in richer families. In the case of urban areas, the number of wealthy \n",
      "persons and families particularly the rising middle class surging with rapid \n",
      "economic growth are staging extravagant displays of food on the occasion \n",
      "such as celebration of marriage, birth in a family and even at the event of \n",

      "imposed thereon. According to him, the money spent on such function does \n",
      "not fall within the scope of “Asraaf”. He submitted that right from the beginning \n",
      "all the laws on the subject including the Ordinance No. II of 2000 were never \n",
      "implemented, as such, there was no need to make such laws. It is urged that \n",

      "177\n",
      "of festivity, good meals and exchange of gifts, etc. He contended that \n",

      "under the Act No. V of 2003 are against Sunnah of the Holy Prophet as he \n",

      "caterers, tent service, light decoration, cooks, waiters and indirectly affect the \n",
      "business of power looms, tent makers, screen printers, chair makers, steel \n",

      "widening economic disparity. According to him, Walima is only “Mubah”, i.e. a \n",
      "permitted act and not obligatory. He submitted that this is also the opinion of \n",
      "the Islamic Ideological Council. He maintains that such wasteful expenses \n",

      "limited number of guests in line with the Ahadith of the Holy Prophet according \n",

      "He submitted that the provincial law also envisages total prohibition on serving \n",
      "of meals at the public places. He candidly stated that in case of repugnancy, \n",
      "the federal law will prevail and the provincial law to the extent of repugnancy, \n",
      "be void in terms of Article 143 of the Constitution. He, however, contended \n",

      "Constitution, which can only be entertained if a question of public importance \n",

      "by Chapter 1 of Part II is involved. No member of the public challenged this \n",
      "law, which means that no one is aggrieved. It is only few contractors who \n",

      "Nikah/marriage, avoidance of “Asraaf” and “Tabzeer” should be the principal \n",

      "on two scores, viz. (a) it is against the Holy Quran and the Sunnah of the Holy \n",
      "Prophet and (b) it militates against Articles 18 and 25 of the Constitution. He \n",

      "Federal Shariat Court and the judgment of that Court is binding on the High \n",

      "examined this law and opined that the restrictions contained in it are in \n",
      "accordance with the Holy Quran and Sunnah. He also submitted that the case \n",
      "law laid down by this Court consistently postulates that the Courts while \n",

      "Injunctions of Islam. He contended that Article 25 is not attracted as the \n",
      "petitioners have not shown that some of the marriage halls are permitted to \n",
      "serve meals but others are not so permitted. To the contrary, the restriction \n",
      "applies to all the marriage halls and hotels alike. Further, the restriction is \n",
      "within the parameters of Article 18, which permits the State to make law \n",
      "aimed at regulating trade, etc. The restriction has been imposed in the public \n",
      "interest and is not unreasonable. \n",
      "14. Mr. Muhammad Hanif Abbasi, applicant in CMA No.1466/2001, submitted \n",
      "that for a long time he remained associated with the business of marriage hall \n",
      "and after having realized that it was absolutely against Shari'ah, he gave up \n",

      "15. Both learned Advocate General Punjab and Advocate General NWFP \n",
      "challenged the maintainability of these petitions on the ground that original \n",

      "Courts and do not oust it. Perusal of clause (3) of Article 184 \n",
      "unequivocally postulates that two conditions are precedent for invoking \n",
      "said clause. Firstly, the petition must clearly demonstrate that the \n",
      "grievance relates to violation of fundamental rights. Secondly, the \n",
      "violation is of nature of public importance, which has been interpreted \n",

      "The issue in order to assume the character of public importance \n",
      "must be such that its decision affects the rights and liberties of \n",
      "people at large. The adjective ‘public’ necessarily implies a thing \n",
      "belonging to people at large, the nation, the State or a \n",
      "community as a whole. Therefore, if a controversy is raised in \n",
      "which only a particular group of people is interested and the \n",
      "body of the people as a whole or the entire community has no \n",

      "“Now, what is meant by a question of public importance. The \n",

      "something pertaining to, or belonging to the people, relating to a \n",
      "nation, State or community…”  \n",
      "“The learned Attorney-General is clearly right in saying that a \n",
      "case does not involve a question of public importance merely \n",
      "because it concerns the arrest and detention of an important \n",

      "19. Anas bin Malik reported that ‘Abd al-Rehman b. ‘Auf came to the Apostle \n",
      "of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he had yellow stains on him. The \n",
      "Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked him what that was. He said, \n",

      "him) asked: “How much have you paid as mahr to her? He said: “Gold equal \n",
      "to the date seed. Thereafter the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) \n",
      "said: Perform Walima even if it be of one sheep. Yahya b. Sa’id reported that \n",
      "the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to perform Walima and \n",
      "there would be neither bread nor meat. Ibn Shihab reported al-A’raj to have \n",

      "tailor prepared some food and invited the Apostle of Allah (may peace be \n",
      " \n",
      "182\n",
      "upon him). Anas said: I too went with the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon \n",

      "seeking out from the dish pieces of pumpkin and eating  them. From that day \n",
      "pumpkin had become my favourite. Anas also reported: On the occasion of \n",
      "wedding feast of Prophet with Safiya, there was no bread or meat, and dates, \n",
      "dried curt and clarified butter were offered. Safiya daughter of Shaiba said the \n",
      "Prophet held a wedding-feast for one of his wives with two mudds [1 Mudd = \n",
      "¾ of a kilogram] of barley. Abu Mas’ud al-Ansari said: One of the Ansar \n",
      "whose Kunya was Abu Shu’aib had a servant who sold meat. He said, \n",
      "“Prepare for me food, which will be enough for five; perhaps I shall invite the \n",
      "Prophet along with four others.” He prepared a small meal for him, and then \n",
      "he went and invited him. A man followed them, and the Prophet said, “A man \n",
      "has followed us, Abu Shu’aib, so if you wish you may let him join us, but if you \n",
      "wish you may leave him outside.” He replied, “No, I shall let him join us.” Anas \n",
      "said the Prophet held a wedding-feast for Safiya with meal and dates. \n",

      "bridegroom intended basically to make the factum of marriage known to the \n",
      "people of the locality lest there is any doubt about the new relationship \n",
      "between a man and a woman. The Walima given by the Holy Prophet (PBUH) \n",
      "on the eve of his marriage with Zainab referred to above consisted of one \n",
      "sheep and it was taken by the people as a big feast. On the eve of his \n",
      "marriages with Safiya and Umm-e-Salama, the Holy Prophet (PBUH) had \n",
      "offered a small quantity (two seers) of jau, halais – a sweat made of cheese, \n",
      "butter and sugar, or dates. On one such occasion the Holy Prophet (PBUH) \n",
      "had asked Anas to go into the street and call the people to the meals in the \n",
      "house of the Prophet. The following principles are deducible from the above \n",
      "discussion: - \n",
      "• Walima invitation is a pre-Islamic concept liked and \n",
      "adopted by the Holy Prophet (PBUH); \n",
      "• Only such items be given in Walima as the person \n",
      "celebrating Walima can afford from his own resources; \n",
      "• The invitation of Walima should be offered to all and sundry \n",
      "in the vicinity and should not be confined to relatives, friends, \n",
      "influentials, etc. \n",
      "21. The Walima and other marriage functions prevalent in our society had \n",
      "been made a source of ostentatious display of wealth inasmuch as the \n",
      "wealthy people spent huge moneys on the occasion of Baraat, Walima and \n",
      "other functions. This has taken the form of Asraaf (extravagance), which is \n",
      "strictly prohibited in the Holy Quran. The Holy Quran says: - \n",
      "22. We have also gone through the research note placed on record, which \n",
      "was submitted before the Islamic Ideological Council in respect of Walima. It \n",
      "concludes that such functions shall be free from “Asraaf” and “Tabzeer” and \n",
      "such functions shall also be free from such actions and deeds, which are \n",
      "prohibited in Islam and may lead towards un-Islamic actions and deeds. No \n",
      "doubt, Walima is a Sunnah, but always it shall be within limits as narrated in \n",

      "183\n",
      "various Ahadith quoted above. Extravagance i.e. ostentatious and wasteful \n",

      "the very beginning. By enormous expenditure of above nature, social vices \n",
      "are created leaving behind horrifying consequences. These evils have \n",
      "generated social inequalities in the society. \n",
      "23. It is significant to note that right from 1953 till 1978 various legislative \n",
      "instruments were promulgated in order to overcome these problems. Some of \n",
      "them are: - \n",
      "1)  \n",
